As a development team we want to be present on many channels (GitHub issues, Twitter, Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions). We want to be responsive and at the same time be effective, for example, we want to avoid having to provide the same answer on different channels. This page describes how the development team intends to use and be active on the different channels.

## GitHub issues

Notice, we don't want to use GitHub Issues for general 'how-to' questions about Code. We will therefore redirect general 'how-to' questions to Stack Overflow. 

## Stack overflow

[`Stack overflow`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) is the best
place for getting high quality answers. Many Code community members are already
on Stack Overflow and provide great answers to 'how-to' questions. A development
team member tracks stack overflow for questions without an answer and jumps in
as needed.

## GitHub Discussions

[`GitHub Discussions`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions)
provides a place where the community can get together and collaborate. It is the
official place to discuss VS Code's extension platform, ask questions, help
other members of the community, and get answers.

The VS Code PM and Advocacy teams have a presence in this community,
periodicially posting announcements and answering questions.

## Slack

Here are a few of the main channels: (you must first [join the Slack workspace](https://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/) before the links below will work)
- [vscode-dev](https://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/C74E1CNGL) for general VS Code discussions.
- [vscode-extensions-dev](https://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/C74CB59NE) for discussions about extension development.
- [vscode-themes](https://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/CBQAQ5GAD/) for discussions about theme authoring.

The VS Code team's presence in this Slack workspace will be optional, at least for the foreseeable future.

## Twitter

Watch for tweets from the [`**@code**`](https://twitter.com/code) account on
twitter for announcements and updates from members of the development team.
