As a development team we want to be present on many channels (GitHub issues,
Twitter, Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions). We want to be responsive and at
the same time be effective, for example, we want to avoid having to provide the
same answer on different channels. This page describes how the development team
intends to use and be active on the different channels.

## GitHub issues

[`GitHub issues`](HTTPS://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) should be used for
bugs and feature requests. How to submit good bugs and feature requests is
described in
[`How to Contribute`](HTTPS://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and how we track issues is described in [[Issue Tracking]].

Notice, we don't want to use GitHub Issues for general 'how-to' questions about
Code. We will therefore redirect general 'how-to' questions to Stack Overflow.

## Stack overflow

[`Stack overflow`](HTTPS://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) is the best
place for getting high quality answers. Many Code community members are already
on Stack Overflow and provide great answers to 'how-to' questions. A development
team member tracks stack overflow for questions without an answer and jumps in
as needed.

> Therefore please do not be upset when we close an issue with the comment to
> ask a question on Stack Overflow.

## GitHub Discussions

[`GitHub Discussions`](HTTPS://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions)
provides a place where the community can get together and collaborate. It is the
official place to discuss VS Code's extension platform, ask questions, help
other members of the community, and get answers.

The VS Code PM and Advocacy teams have a presence in this community,
periodicially posting announcements and answering questions.

## Slack

The [`Visual Studio Code Development Community`]() Slack workspace is a community
maintained place for VS Code contributors, extension developers, theme authors,
etc to help one another and collaborate. This Slack workspace contains many
discussion channels including many for specific extensions.

Here are a few of the main channels: (you must first
[`join the Slack workspace`](HTTPS://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/) before the
links below will work)

-   [`vscode-dev`](HTTPS://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/C74E1CNGL) for
    general VS Code discussions.
-   [`vscode-extensions-dev`](HTTPS://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/C74CB59NE)
    for discussions about extension development.
-   [`vscode-themes`](HTTPS://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/CBQAQ5GAD/)
    for discussions about theme authoring.

The VS Code team's presence in this Slack workspace will be optional, at least
for the foreseeable future.

## Twitter

Watch for tweets from the [`**@code**`](HTTPS://twitter.com/code) account on
twitter for announcements and updates from members of the development team.
